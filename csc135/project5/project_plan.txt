Assignment: Project 5

1.Program will read a file and use the data to output bills for each table in the file.

2.Program collects the number of seats and the price per seat
    from the file.
Outputs the table number, subtotal, tax, tip, and total
    on a bill.
Subtotal = subtotal + seatprice to collect total of a table
    tax = subtotal * 0.07 to get tax of the table
    tip = subtotal * .2 or .25 depending on the number of people
No constraints
Assume the file data is formatted correctly, file is in the
    directory and user will type the filename correctly

3.Program will take in the user's input of filename and try to open
    the file. If it fails an error is printed and program exits.
    File is read for each table the seats and subtotal is taken.
    The rest of the bill is calculated and passed into a function
        to print the bill.

4.Write several test files with different values.
    Many tables, no tables, an empty table (test[1 through 5].txt
